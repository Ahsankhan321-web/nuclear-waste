mechanism by which it spontaneously releases its excess energy. Typical mechanisms for radioactive decay are alpha, beta, and gamma emission. Alpha decay is a process that is usually associated with heavy atoms, such as uranium-238 and thorium-234, where excess energy is given off with the ejection of two neutrons and two protons from the nucleus. Beta decay involves the ejection of a beta particle, which is the same as an electron, from the nucleus of an excited atom. A common example of a beta-emitter found in radioactive waste is strontium-90. After an alpha or beta decay, the nucleus of an atom is often in an excited state and still has excess energy. Rather than releasing this energy by alpha or beta decay, energy is lost by gamma emission—a pulse of electromagnetic radiation from the nucleus of an atom.
Everything on Earth is exposed to radiation. However, exposure to radiation at levels greater than natural background radiation can be hazardous. Exposure to certain high levels of radiation, such as that from high-level radioactive waste, can even cause death. Radiation exposure can also cause cancer, birth defects, and other abnormalities, depending on the time of exposure, amount of radiation, and the decay mechanism. High-level radioactive waste from nuclear reactors can be hazardous for thousands of years. Radioactive waste can be categorized by its source or point of origin. Because of this, the governments of many nations have developed waste classification systems to regulate the management of radioactive waste within their borders. The proper treatment, storage, and disposal of radioactive waste are prescribed based on the waste classification system defined in a nation's laws, rules, and regulations. The table outlines common categories of radioactive waste.


Radioactive Waste Description
Radioactive waste can vary greatly in its physical and chemical form. It can be a solid, liquid, gas, or even something in between, such as sludge. Any given radioactive waste can be primarily water, soil, paper, plastic, metal, ash, glass, ceramic, or a mixture of many different physical forms. The chemical form of radioactive waste can vary as well. Radioactive waste can contain radionuclides of very light elements, such as radioactive hydrogen (tritium), or of very heavy elements, such as uranium. Radioactive waste is classified as high, intermediate, or low level. Depending on the radionuclides contained in it, a waste can remain radioactive from seconds to minutes, or even for millions of years.


Radioactive Waste Management
Radioactive waste management includes the possession, transportation, handling, storage, and ultimate disposal of waste. The safe management of radioactive waste is necessary to protect public health. If handled improperly, potential exposures of humans to high-level radioactive waste can be dangerous, even deadly. Some radioactive wastes such as certain types of transuranic waste can cause biological effects in humans only if the radionuclides contained in the waste are directly inhaled or ingested. Most low-level radioactive wastes can be handled by humans without any measurable biological effects. Nevertheless, good handling practices of all radioactive materials and waste should be the goal to provide optimum protection to humans and the environment. There have been historic practices associated with the use of radioactive material where workers were unaware of potential risks. The radium watch dial painters of the 1920s illustrate the health effects that can be associated with improper handling practices. The painters experienced high occurrences of cancer of the larynx and tongue due to ingestion of radium.

The transportation of radioactive waste can occur via roadway, aircraft, ship/barge, and rail. The classification and physical size of radioactive waste dictate the method of transport, the packaging required, and the labeling necessary to allow for the shipment of a specific waste. There are international transportation requirements for radioactive waste, as well as more specific regulations in individual countries.


Radioactive Waste Disposal
Various methods to manage and dispose of radioactive waste have been considered. Proposed management and disposal methods have included the

Common Categories of Radioactive Waste
COMMON CATEGORIES OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE
Waste Category	Description of Waste Category	Common Sources of Waste	Common Radionuclides in Waste and Their Half-Life (y=years)
High-Level Radioactive Waste	Highly radioactive material that is deemed a waste that requires special precautions by humans, including remote handling and use of shielding; also includes spent fuel and waste resulting from the reprocessing of used fuel	Partially used fuel from nuclear power reactors; liquid waste from the reprocessing of spent fuel taking place outside the United States	strontium-90 half-life: 29.78 y
cesium-137 half-life: 30.07 y
Transuranic Waste	Material that is deemed a waste that contains radionuclides with an atomic number greater than that of uranium (92)	Weapons-production waste included mixed transuranic waste	plutonium-238 half-life: 87.7 y
americium-241 half-life: 432.7 y
Mixed Waste	Material that is deemed a waste that contains both radionuclides and a characteristic or listed hazardous waste	Weapons-production waste and some research wastes	plutonium-239 half-life: 24,100 y
plutonium-241 half-life: 14.4 y
Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (NORM) Waste	Material that is deemed a waste that contains radionuclides that are present on Earth without any human interaction	Scale buildup on pipe walls that carry petroleum products	radium-226 half-life: 1,599 y
radium-228 half-life: 5.76 y
Uranium or Thorium Mill Tailings Waste	The tailings material created as a by-product by the extraction of uranium or thorium from natural ore formations	Production exclusively at the site of milling for rare earth extraction	radium-226 half-life: 1,599 y
thorium-230 half-life: 75,400 y
Low-Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW)(and Intermediate Waste outside U.S.)	Material that is deemed a waste that generally has been contaminated by or contains short-lived radionuclides or longer-lived radionuclides in relatively low concentrations. Low-level radioactive waste is further segregated into classes (see below)	Industrial trash from nuclear power plants; medical, research, and academic trash such as paper, plastic, and
